# StreamFlix Frontend Environment Variables

# Proxy Server Configuration (Development vs Production)
# Development: Point to local proxy server
VITE_TMDB_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Production: Point to deployed proxy server (update with your actual proxy URL)
# VITE_TMDB_BASE_URL=https://your-streamflix-proxy.vercel.app

# TMDB Image URLs (These come directly from TMDB's CDN)
VITE_TMDB_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500

# Note: TMDB API key is no longer needed in frontend - it's handled securely by the proxy server
# This improves security by keeping API keys on the backend only
